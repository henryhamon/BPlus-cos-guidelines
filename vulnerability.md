## Xecuter

:red_circle: Fatal.

The use of XECUTE command has security and performance implications:

```cos
    xecute "do ..something()"
```
* Security: the command to be executed may be a user input; if validation is not performed thoroughly, malicious code may be executed.
* Performance: the string input needs to be constructed (if not a single string literal but a concatenation of strings, for instnace) and evaluated.

For these reasons, you should avoid using XECUTE and use a proper set of commands instead.
